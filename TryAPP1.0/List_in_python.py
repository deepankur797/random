'''
Lists are very similar to arrays.
They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish.
 Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner.
  Here is an example of how to build a list
'''

myList=[]
myList.append(1)
myList.append(2)
myList.append(3)

print(myList[0])

for x in myList:
    print(x)
